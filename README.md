This porject is used to learn muduo recipes
with 2 minor changes from the [source code](https://github.com/chenshuo/recipes/tree/master/reactor).

- The base part comes from [2.x muduo base](https://github.com/chenshuo/muduo/tree/master/muduo/base).
- Use CMake to build the project. And built the base part as a static library.

Usage: 
1. cd learn_muduo_recipes
2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake ..
5. make 

And then all the test programs will be "somewhere" in this build folder :)
